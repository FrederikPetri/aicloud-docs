### Example
These directories are not created automatically. Users are free to create these directories themselves, on the condition that they remove their group directories and their files, when they are finished with using the platform. Students should expect their directories to be cleaned at the end of every semester.

Begin by navigating to the relevant subdirectory:

- If you are a student, go in to the students project-directory: `cd /home/project/students`
- If you are a researcher, go in to the researchers project-directory: `cd /home/project/researchers`

A project directory can be created in the following manner:

    mkdir <name> 

To ensure the tidyness of this directory we ask you to, name this directory after the name of your *group* or *research project*.

Files can now be transferred to this directory according to ou [file transfer guide](./transfer_files.md).
