!!! info "Please review our [Guidelines](../help-and-resources/guidelines.md), especially noting the following points:"
      - AI Cloud is not intended for working with confidential or sensitive data
      - If your application does not require a GPU, other platforms are better suited instead. Feel free to [contact CLAAUDIA](../help-and-resources/support.md) for guidance on more suitable alternatives.
