# Group project directories

Directories can be created for sharing data with multiple users. These directories are not created automatically, but users are free to create these directories themselves on the condition that they remove their group directories and their files, when they are finished with using the platform. Students should expect their directories to be cleaned at the end of every semester.

!!! note
    Group project directories support [data classification level 0](https://www.security.aau.dk/data-classification/the-four-data-types-at-aau)

Your projects directory is a subdirectory to an overall `project directories` folder hierarchy, and doing this therefore depends on whether you are a researcher or student.

=== "Reasearcher"
    
    Go in to the researchers project-directory:
    ```
    cd /home/project/researchers
    ```
    
    Before going ahead and creating a directory for group project, please consider naming the directory in a meaningful manner (ie. after your group or research project)
    A project directory can be created in the following manner (swap out `<name>` for the actual name of your project).
    ```
    mkdir <name> 
    ``` 

=== "Student"

    Go in to the students project-directory: 
    ```
    cd /home/project/students
    ``` 
    
    Before going ahead and creating a directory for group project, please consider naming the directory in a meaningful manner (ie. after your group or research project)
    A project directory can be created in the following manner (swap out `<name>` for the actual name of your project).
    ```
    mkdir <name> 
    ``` 

Please remember, that these directories should be deleted when your project is finished, and you no longer need them. They are *not* intended for long term data storage.

Happy computing!
